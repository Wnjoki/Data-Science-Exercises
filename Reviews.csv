"We came there after long trip, our room was not ready, but manager was so kind and gave us another room to rest, that was very helpful and nice. Food there is amazing, anyone can find something, no matter which food preferences you have. When we got our room, we were impressed of size and now modern it was. Especially I would like to mention bathroom, was like a proper 5 stars hotel, with impressive variety of amenities. I recommend everyone to visit this place.",5
"Overall the stay was absolutely fantastic. The meals were great.. A particular shout out to Angela at the restaurant. Her hospitality was unmatched. The lodge was extremely beautiful and well maintained.",5
"The reception needs to have better communication. Nelson was of great help. However, Judy at the reception was quite rude. We had agreed on a late check out by the Duty Manager, however she came knocking on our door and rudely spoke to us about how we need to leave. Not a good note to leave on.",2
"My family and I had an excellent vacation. The lodge is located on a hill and since my family and I love nature, we decided to try it out. it was such an amazing experience. The food is very yummy and they kept changing the menu to our liking. On our last evening they had the Swahili menu Oh My! It was so delicious kudos to the chefs 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾The staff are amazing very friendly and caring and ready to assist. Great customer service 👌👌kudos to Jayne and the team for making our holiday experience wonderful.",4
"Sarova Lion Hill is a great place to be especially during the festive season. Amazing big place, lots of activities to do apart from game drives, they have a heated pool, snooker table, table tennis, badminton. Not to mention lots of fun things for kids too like bracelets making, trampoline, bouncing castle, wet slide, movies at night etc. The staff is very friendly and go out of their way to serve and help you. The food was great with so so many options. The beds were cosy and comfortable. The rooms were clean and decent. Had a wonderful stay.",5
"We had a great stay at Sarova Lion Hill Game Lodge. As in every other Sarova Hotel we stayed at during our one-week trip to Kenya, we experienced very nice, friendly and helpful staff.",5
"The restaurant is amazing. There's surely something to find for everyone at the buffet. They also have a fire bowl next to the bar, making it very cozy to sit there in the evening.",5
"Low class décor.Few waiters and waitress.They take too much time to serve customers.Unavailability of common items like warm water.",1
"Their services are not consistencies, sometimes you can be disappointed due the long waiting for what you ordered even if the population of customer is not that big.",2
"Everything was perfect. It was very impressive that the temperature and humidity of the room, the humidity control of the bathroom, the noise level of the fan, the comfort of the bed, the room service, the use of the mini bar, and the feedback of the customers were reflected during the stay. One disappointment was that the breakfast menu was very similar. thank you. This is a hotel I would like to visit again.",5
"Best restaurant, services offered are so good. The attendants are welcoming, accommodative and hospitable",4
"Customer service, friendly waiters and cleanliness and not to mention the taste of the food. Can't fail to go back again! The food prices are pocket friendly too.",4
"Terrible. Since you started charging CASH, the quality of your food especially beef has dropped drastically!",2
"My hormones always take me back here for the Nyama choma. You can never have enough of that slightly crispy, salted to perfection mbuzi choma served there.",5
"To my shock, the first time I visited, the prices were very fair and the food has been consistent ever since.""My husband and I always try to stay at the Hotel Phillips when we are in Kansas City. It is our favorite hotel and we have stayed at many. I feel at home there and the staff has always been exceptional, although we are not particularly demanding guests. Over the years we have probably spent at least 20 nights there.,5
"The hotel is just one of many that are on this new trend of firmer pillows and mattresses. This is the third hotel I have stayed in the last few months that have had firmer vs softer mattresses in their rooms. Aside from the bed The room was well appointed, comfortable and really The bonus Those super plushy and comfy robes in the closet. I miss a good hotel robe and this one had one!! Another little thing I loved was the spa water and coffee service in the lobby. High quality coffee and the New York Times Count me in! The maid service was friendly, attentive, and I even got a little note. Would totally stay again.","Convenient, cute and moderately comfrotable",5
"excellent location near convention center. friendly, willing staff. not a true luxury hotel in terms of the room I received, but a comfortable clean room, I didn't really need any more than that. After all you're here to visit San Francisco, not the hotel.",Perfectly fine hotel for a visit .",4
"Nice hotel. But the room design is flawed (if not ridiculous) with safety issue: too sharp edged metal handles on all doors (of the closets and bathroom) and extruded from the desk drawers. I got scratched on my leg while trying to get up from a chair in front of the desk. It hurts a lot, luckily no bleeding.",3
"Beautiful location. Big rooms. Nice atmosphere. Some lack in the service. We have been there for a fair. Checkout the last day was a deasaster. Only one person at the reception. Then they have also a problem with the parking ticket. Not expected by a 5 * Hotel.",4
"The hotel in itself is nice, but there are many areas to improve when it comes to meeting organization. Already to get an offer the team seem chronically understaffed, and takes a long time to reply by email. The day before of the event I was told only an external provider could help me with the audio and he was not only expensive but also not available. We only needed a microphone but the hotel failed to provide despite it had been announced we were hosting a hybrid event. It was a lot of stress for us to what I think is quite a basic equipment. Despite the hiccups we had a fantastic time and food was also really nice.The reply from owner below is very disappointing, unprofessional and not true. The event was announced from the very beginning as a hybrid event. I visited the facility one week before the event to make sure we had all the equipment. During this preparation meeting I was told I would be put in contact with a person but was not informed this included a fee. I contacted the mentioned provider the week before and he did not provide an offer until the day before the event. I asked to correct a few items as he included many extras which were not needed. I was given 15m to decide on his new offer. He then withdrew the offer as he no longer had personnel availability. The equipment I brought on the day was a plan B, completely irrelevant to the situation here described. The single microphone we needed was not provided.",1
