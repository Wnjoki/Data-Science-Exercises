Review
"We came there after long trip, our room was not ready, but manager was so kind and gave us another room to rest, that was very helpful and nice. Food there is amazing, anyone can find something, no matter which food preferences you have. When we got our room, we were impressed of size and now modern it was. Especially I would like to mention bathroom, was like a proper 5 stars hotel, with impressive variety of amenities. I recommend everyone to visit this place."
Overall the stay was absolutely fantastic. The meals were great.. A particular shout out to Angela at the restaurant. Her hospitality was unmatched. The lodge was extremely beautiful and well maintained.
"The reception needs to have better communication. Nelson was of great help. However, Judy at the reception was quite rude. We had agreed on a late check out by the Duty Manager, however she came knocking on our door and rudely spoke to us about how we need to leave. Not a good note to leave on."
"My family and I had an excellent vacation. The lodge is located on a hill and since my family and I love nature, we decided to try it out. it was such an amazing experience. The food is very yummy and they kept changing the menu to our liking. On our last evening they had the Swahili menu Oh My! It was so delicious kudos to the chefs 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾The staff are amazing very friendly and caring and ready to assist. Great customer service 👌👌kudos to Jayne and the team for making our holiday experience wonderful."
"Sarova Lion Hill is a great place to be especially during the festive season. Amazing big place, lots of activities to do apart from game drives, they have a heated pool, snooker table, table tennis, badminton. Not to mention lots of fun things for kids too like bracelets making, trampoline, bouncing castle, wet slide, movies at night etc. The staff is very friendly and go out of their way to serve and help you. The food was great with so so many options. The beds were cosy and comfortable. The rooms were clean and decent. Had a wonderful stay."
"We had a great stay at Sarova Lion Hill Game Lodge. As in every other Sarova Hotel we stayed at during our one-week trip to Kenya, we experienced very nice, friendly and helpful staff."
"The rooms are spacious and clean, but tend to be a little warm during the night since there's no fan."
"The restaurant is amazing. There's surely something to find for everyone at the buffet. They also have a fire bowl next to the bar, making it very cozy to sit there in the evening."
Low class décor.Few waiters and waitress.They take too much time to serve customers.Unavailability of common items like warm water
"Their services are not consistencies, sometimes you can be disappointed due the long waiting for what you ordered even if the population of customer is not that big."
Their food is standard only serving timing is not convenient. Let them work on this.
"Best restaurant, services offered are so good. The attendants are welcoming, accommodative and hospitable"
"Customer service, friendly waiters and cleanliness and not to mention the taste of the food. Can't fail to go back again! The food prices are pocket friendly too."
"Terrible. Since you started charging CASH, the quality of your food especially beef has dropped drastically!"
"My hormones always take me back here for the Nyama choma. You can never have enough of that slightly crispy, salted to perfection mbuzi choma served there."
"To my shock, the first time I visited, the prices were very fair and the food has been consistent ever since."
"I enjoyed their goat liver with ""Mbaazi Mukimo"". And soup..Their service was fast and friendly..The meals are also affordable."
Not all you can eat. Disappointing. Many items missing from menu so it is best to ask what is left instead of choosing something
Ordered take away one morning while rushing and didn't experience delay. Enjoyed the hot drink as well
