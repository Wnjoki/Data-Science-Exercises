Review,Remark
"We came there after long trip, our room was not ready, but manager was so kind and gave us another room to rest, that was very helpful and nice. Food there is amazing, anyone can find something, no matter which food preferences you have. When we got our room, we were impressed of size and now modern it was. Especially I would like to mention bathroom, was like a proper 5 stars hotel, with impressive variety of amenities. I recommend everyone to visit this place.",positive
Overall the stay was absolutely fantastic. The meals were great.. A particular shout out to Angela at the restaurant. Her hospitality was unmatched. The lodge was extremely beautiful and well maintained.,positive
"The reception needs to have better communication. Nelson was of great help. However, Judy at the reception was quite rude. We had agreed on a late check out by the Duty Manager, however she came knocking on our door and rudely spoke to us about how we need to leave. Not a good note to leave on."
"My family and I had an excellent vacation. The lodge is located on a hill and since my family and I love nature, we decided to try it out. it was such an amazing experience. The food is very yummy and they kept changing the menu to our liking. On our last evening they had the Swahili menu Oh My! It was so delicious kudos to the chefs 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾The staff are amazing very friendly and caring and ready to assist. Great customer service 👌👌kudos to Jayne and the team for making our holiday experience wonderful.",positive
"Sarova Lion Hill is a great place to be especially during the festive season. Amazing big place, lots of activities to do apart from game drives, they have a heated pool, snooker table, table tennis, badminton. Not to mention lots of fun things for kids too like bracelets making, trampoline, bouncing castle, wet slide, movies at night etc. The staff is very friendly and go out of their way to serve and help you. The food was great with so so many options. The beds were cosy and comfortable. The rooms were clean and decent. Had a wonderful stay.",positive
